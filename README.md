In this application I used MySQL to create, seed, and update database files for the purposes of personnel record keeping in a business setting. We are able to access, full lists of departments, available roles with their associated salaries and departments, and full list of employees which include, title/role, salary, and identify employees associated manager using the employee_id number. You can also add Departments, Roles, and Employees, as well as Update existing employee information. This application was written in JavaScript, and uses NPM Node and Inquirer for CLI functionality.
